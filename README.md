# Getting Started with Create React App
Front end : React.js, ES6
For Unit test Cases : React testing library

# Description
I have create a web application to allow user to enter the search string and calling search api on button click.
I am using component state to manage and display the search result. Due to time limit, I have kept basic UI. I have not added router. Search result display could have been improved by adding table and pagination.
